# How To Use
Video tutorial coming soon!

## Linux
```
git clone https://git.cbps.xyz/swindlesmccoop/DDLC-Plus-Backport
cd DDLC-Plus-Backport
chmod +x backport.sh
./backport.sh [distro]
```
The distro argument should be the ditribution you are on so that I can make sure you have all of the necessary dependencies installed. Below is a list of the most popular distributions and what you should enter for each one:\
Arch, Artix, Manjaro, Garuda: `arch`\
Debian, Ubuntu, Pop\_OS!: `debian`\
Gentoo and other distributions: `skip` *Note: you will need to check the dependencies list and make sure you have all of them, however.*

## Windows
Download and install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/), then open it.
```
git clone https://git.cbps.xyz/swindlesmccoop/DDLC-Plus-Backport
cd DDLC-Plus-Backport
sh backport.sh
```

# Issues and Troubleshooting
Either submit an issue on the issues tab *or* you can email me at swindlesmccoop@waifu.club.

# Purpose
This is purely an experimental project to test the flexibility of the Ren'Py engine. It is not designed to be played in lieu of the official DDLC, nor in lieu of DDLC Plus. You should download and play both games first.

# Legality
It's against Team Salvato's IP guidelines to distribute a mod with DDLC Plus content for any game besides DDLC Plus. By all technicality, I am not even distributing an actual mod - I'm merely distributing a script that allows an individual user to experience the new content of DDLC Plus in the original engine *after* they have already played both games. I am not distributing any officially licensed assets in this repository, such as the code to any features or scenes, nor any multimedia files, nor does the script give the user a means to accessing them. I do not encourage nor condone piracy, and all content required for this script should be obtained through legitimate means.
```
Features, scenes, and assets that originate from DDLC Plus may NOT be ported, replicated, or included in mods or Fan games. Mods of the original DDLC should only use assets present in the original game, as well as any assets you create yourself. Fan games and mods should not seek to replicate or replace DDLC Plus.
```
If you do not know how to legally obtain the assets, you can email me and we can discuss it.
