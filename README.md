# Purpose
Port all of the content in the expanded port of DDLC back to the original Ren'Py engine from the new Unity engine.

# Legality
I think it's against the modding terms of service to distribute a mod with DDLC Plus content for any game besides DDLC Plus, but...I don't really care.\
If I ever end up posting this on R\*ddit, it will be a script that extracts the assets from the .cy files and arranges them, then places the modded .rpy files and the new images into the DDLC folder as a patch. This way, I can comply with the rules by not distributing their content. Don't worry about that here, though - I'll provide full asset releases.
